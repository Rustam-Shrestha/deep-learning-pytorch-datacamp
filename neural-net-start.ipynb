    "Deep learning models require:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Large datasets (hundreds of thousands or more)\n",
    "- High computational resources\n",
    "- Careful tuning and validation\n",

    "## 5. PyTorch Tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental data structure in PyTorch is a **tensor**, which is similar to an array or matrix. Tensors support many mathematical operations and form the building blocks of neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors can be created from:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python lists\n",

    "\n",
    "## 6. Tensor Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Important tensor attributes include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `tensor.shape`: Displays the shape of the tensor\n",
    "- `tensor.dtype`: Displays the data type (e.g., 64-bit integer)\n",
    "\n",
    "Checking these attributes ensures tensors align correctly with the model and task, and helps with debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Tensor Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors support various operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Addition and subtraction**: Requires tensors of the same shape\n",
    "- **Element-wise multiplication**: Multiplies corresponding elements of tensors with the same shape\n",
    "- **Matrix multiplication**: Combines rows of the first matrix with columns of the second matrix and sums the results\n",

    "\n",
    "## 8. Behind the Scenes in Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning models perform countless operations such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Addition\n",
    "- Multiplication\n",
    "- Matrix transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "These operations are used to process data and learn patterns.\n",

    "## 9. Additional Concepts to Explore\n",
    "\n",
    "To deepen your understanding of PyTorch and deep learning, explore:\n",
